This project is a tank video game with an integrated level editor.

Project uses Processing as a core library for the graphic output.
Project is not completed. You can try the first level, but the AI of the enemies is pretty simple. The tank control system is oriented for mobile device but the project right now is availiable as a desktop version only.

Levels editor makes it possible to edit the first level. You can add new blocks, graphic elements and collectables.

Project uses my own NES graphic library to create GUI in 8-bit style.

The project can be used to learn a possible architecture of level editors.
